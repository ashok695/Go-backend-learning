LOOPS
    For loop is single loop which is used for everything
    for i:= 0;i<=5;i++{
        //logic
    }
    LOOPS FOR ARRAYS || SLICES
    for _, n := range <Name of arr> { -> here _ -> index , n -> value of that index
        // here we will print only n
    }
ARRAYS:
    -> used to store the continuous Variable && Length can't be changed
    syntax:   var <ARRAY-NAME> [ <LENGTH OF ARRAY] <DATA-TYPE>
    decalration <ARRAY-NAME> = [ ... ] <DATA-TYPE> { "VALUE","VALUE","VALUE"}
    // in single line
    var <ARRAY-NAME> []<DATA-TYPE> = []<DATA-TYPE> { "VALUE1" "VALUE2"}
SLICES:
    -> used to create dynamic ARRAY
    -> same syntax as array but length we will not given 
    -> var <SLICE-NAME> [ EMPTY ]<DATA-TYPE>
    -> adding data into slice - <SLICE-NAME> = append(<slicename> , value)
    -> 2 important func -> len, cap
